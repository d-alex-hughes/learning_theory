* Learning Theory 

This directed reading group is going to cover intermediate and advanced learning theory. The core reading is going to be this [[https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs229t/notes.pdf][notes]], which were taken in support of this [[https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs229t/][course]], offered at our neighbors on the other side of the bay. Great, great work.
